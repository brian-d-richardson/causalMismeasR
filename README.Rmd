# mismex: causal inference with a mismeasured exposure <img id="mismex_hex" src="man/figures/mismex_hex.png" align="right" width="125"/>

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Installation 

Installation of `mismex` from GitHub requires the [`devtools`](https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/pandoc/devtools.html) package and can be done with the following code: 

```{r, eval = F}
# install the package
devtools::install_github(repo = "brian-d-richardson/mismex", 
                         ref = "main")
```
```{r}
# load the package
library(mismex)
```

The `mismex` package contains functions to estimate causal effects in the presence of confounding and a mismeasured exposure. The methods implemented are introduced in the paper, "Addressing confounding and continuous exposure measurement error using corrected score functions," which is currently in progress.
